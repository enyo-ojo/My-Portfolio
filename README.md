# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| 💊 [Mental Health Prediction](https://github.com/enyo-ojo/MachineLearning-EnsembleModel-forDepressionPrediction) | Machine learning, Programming | This repo contains the solution to the [Kaggle Mental Health Prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11). The project involved thorough data cleaning, filling of missing values using statistical modelling, and an ensemble modelling technique for prediction, including voting and accuracy with an achieved accuracy of **94%**. | Ensemble modelling(Gradient boosting, tree and classification models), scikit-learn, Smote, Pandas, Seaborn | 
| 💲💱 [Dynamic Pricing Model](https://github.com/enyo-ojo/Random_Forest-Dynamic-Pricing-Model) |  Pricing Optimization, Predictive Modelling | I performed data synthesis to gather this data for an Asian K-pop Dance Studio experiencing low ROI and Profit. The aim was to help the studio come up with prices that would help the company stay profitable while still attracting customers. The solution was this dynamic pricing model. Performed Feature engineering and statistical analysis before modelling | Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, Random Forest, feature importance |   
| ☎️📺 [Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/enyo-ojo/Snowflake-Custormer-Churn--Analysis-and-Prediction) | Churn Analysis, Predictive Modelling, Word Cloud (Sentiment Analysis) | Analysis on Telco Customer Churn Kaggle Project. I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis using SQL in Snowflake warehousing. Then, feature engineering and statistical analysis and conducted modelling focusing on precision and recall for churned customer as the goal was to predict customer were likely to churnurn. |  pandas, matplotlib, plotly, nltk, xgboost(scikit-learn), numpy, imblearn |   
| 💻 [Youtube Streamlit Dashboard](https://github.com/enyo-ojo/yt_dashboard_proj) | Data storytelling and Visualization |Created a streamlit dashboard to show data insights from a YouTube creators channel on their most popular videos, topics, and audience. This dashboard was my introduction to Snowflake's Streamlit platform, and it provided insights on the Creator's planning for YouTube videos and how to relate to their audience. [Dashboard](https://enyojo-first-st-app-youtubedashoard.streamlit.app/) |  pandas, mat, plotly, streamlit, datetime, numpy |
